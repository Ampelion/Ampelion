- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ampelion
- 👀 I’m a biologist originally trained in evolutionary biology and I spent the early part of my career studying birds all over the Neotropics
- 🌱 I got in on the earliest days of bioinformatics...bnack when it was called Big Data and we used BeoWolf clusters to buff up our compute power.
-     Since then I've done a lot of things, learned some stuff and now I am back to embrace the computational side of science.
- 💞️ I really enjoy applying my experiences to systems thinking and understanding larger patterns among all the data we have available
- 📫 How to reach me spingus@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have caught bats out of the air with my bare hands
- I like Cars, birds, bikes, andmost of all, SCIENCE!
